Haiku aspires to be the Platonic ideal form of a static site generator.  It
provides nothing more than simple tools to parse markdown and inject it into
html templates.

## Why?

Many static site generators impose some sort of structure on the websites they
create. Haiku doesn't require a certain directory structure or make you learn
how to work with or around features like "blog awareness" before you can create
your site. At the same time, it provides a set of features that make it simple
to create a blog or any other sort of site.
