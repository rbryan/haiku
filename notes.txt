Two ways to use haiku
	-As a simple executable
	-As a simple framework

Don't forget about function calls from markdown

Current Dependencies:
	-cl-mustache
	-cl-markdown
	-split-sequence

Current problem:
   For whatever god-forsaken reason assoc doesn't like to work when checking for 'extends, 'body etc in bindings. WTF


To build:
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'haiku)

To test:
  (asdf:test-system 'haiku)
